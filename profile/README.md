# Welcome

Welcome to Memoriae Technology, where we embark on a journey towards unknown and undiscovered lands.

Specializing in simulations, our work revolves around groundbreaking research in time and cybernetics, not only creating the boundaries of traditional technology but also seeking to prove that universes beyond these boundaries can exist.

Our expertise is in producing experimental technological findings and constantly expanding our understanding of cybernetics. In its general scope, it is to scientifically reveal the limits to which human-machine interaction will expand.

At the core of our journey is our motto, “Remember the Future,” a mantra that encapsulates our mission to reshape the future by learning from the past and innovating in the present.

## Our Vision

We are not just creators but pioneers, venturing into uncharted territories of technology. Our work revolves around groundbreaking research that seeks to redefine the boundaries of traditional technology, exploring possibilities that extend far beyond the known.

## Specialization

Our expertise lies in producing experimental technological findings, particularly in the field of cybernetics. We strive to scientifically reveal the extent of human-machine interaction, pushing the limits of current understanding and technology. 

### Simulations

At Memoriae Technology, simulations are more than just digital constructs; they are windows into complex systems and scenarios, offering insights into the realms of the possible and the yet-to-be-discovered.

### Time and Cybernetics Research

Our research in time and cybernetics is not confined to theoretical explorations. We actively seek practical applications and innovative solutions that challenge the status quo, bringing futuristic concepts into today's reality.

## Our Motto: "Remember The Future"

"Remember The Future" - This is not just a slogan, but the essence of our philosophy. It embodies our commitment to learning from the past and innovating in the present to reshape the future. It is a reminder that the future is not a distant dream but a reality we are actively creating. We chose this approach as an expression of the cyclicality of time and that it does not actually flow in a single direction.

## Join Us

If you have the belief and ideas that you can push the limits, you are actually already involved.

We not only invite you, but we also hope to find you wherever you are in the world, if you are close to these approaches.

Now, join us as we embark on this exciting journey to redefine what is possible and reveal how close the impossible is to reality.
